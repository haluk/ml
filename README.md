# ID3 Implementation

In order to compile and run the program, one should simply type the
following commands in the terminal. Note that, this implementation is
tested on scala-2.11.8 and sbt-0.13.12.

make

make run=house-votes-84.properties

We receive the input parameters for the program as in the example
properties file for each data set. In order to run the program with
parameters in the properties file, one should give the respected
properties file to a make run rule.
